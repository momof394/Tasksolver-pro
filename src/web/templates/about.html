    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
        You might wonder how we keep this platform free. Here's our transparent approach:
    </p>
    <ul style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8; margin-left: 2rem;">
        <li><strong>Voluntary Support:</strong> Users who find value in our platform can choose to support us through voluntary donations.</li>
        <li><strong>Partnerships:</strong> We may partner with wellness-focused organizations that align with our values.</li>
        <li><strong>Ethical Advertising:</strong> If we ever include ads, they'll be relevant, non-intrusive, and focused on wellness and personal development.</li>
        <li><strong>Consulting:</strong> We offer consulting services for organizations wanting to implement similar wellness-focused tools.</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8; margin-top: 1rem;">
        <strong>What we'll never do:</strong> Sell your data, create artificial limitations, or charge for basic features.

    <h2 style="color: #667eea; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Our Story</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8;">
        Tasksolver Pro began as a task management platform but evolved into something much more meaningful. 
        We realized that what people really needed wasn't just another productivity tool, but a holistic platform 
        that supports their overall well-being while helping them create and share valuable content.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8; margin-top: 1rem;">
        The transformation happened when we started focusing on the human element - the stress, the need for self-care, 
        the desire to help others, and the barriers that prevent people from accessing tools for personal growth. 
        That's when we decided to make everything free and focus on wellness.
